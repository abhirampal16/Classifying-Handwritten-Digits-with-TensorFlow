# Classifying-Handwritten-Digits-with-TensorFlow
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build and evaluate a machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).
