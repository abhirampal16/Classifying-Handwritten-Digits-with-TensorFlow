# Handwritten Digit Classification with TensorFlow
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build and evaluate a machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).

# Contents
# 1. Data Loading: The notebook begins by loading the MNIST dataset from TensorFlow's built-in datasets. The dataset includes labeled images of handwritten digits.
# 2. Data Preprocessing: The images are reshaped, normalized, and split into training and test sets to prepare them for model training.
# 3. Model Building: A neural network model is constructed using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model consists of multiple layers, including:
- Flatten Layer: To convert the 2D image arrays into 1D arrays.
- Dense Layers: Fully connected layers with activation functions to introduce non-linearity and learn complex patterns.
# 4. Model Compilation: The model is compiled with a loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
# 5. Training: The model is trained on the training dataset, and its performance is tracked over several epochs.
# 6. Evaluation: The model's accuracy and loss are evaluated on the test set, and the results are displayed using metrics and visualizations.
# 7. Predictions: The notebook demonstrates how to make predictions on new handwritten digit images, showcasing the model's ability to classify them correctly.


# Conclusion
This notebook provides an end-to-end guide on how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model for handwritten digit classification using TensorFlow. It serves as a practical introduction to machine learning and TensorFlow for real-world tasks.
